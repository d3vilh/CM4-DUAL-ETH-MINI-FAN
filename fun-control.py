# v.0.2 by d3vilh 2025. 
# This script is designed to control a fan speed based on temperature readings.
# It uses the GPIO library to interact with the Raspberry Pi's GPIO pins.
# The script reads the temperature from a thermal zone file and adjusts the PWM signal to control the fan speed. 
# It also uses edge detection to measure the fan speed by counting the number of pulses from a fan's tachometer output.
# The script runs indefinitely until interrupted by the user (Ctrl+C).
# It is important to note that this script requires the RPi.GPIO library to be installed and the script to be run with root privileges.
# The script is designed to be run on a Raspberry Pi with a fan connected to the specified GPIO pins.
